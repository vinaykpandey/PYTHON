Instance Methods

Class Methods

Static Methods

Class Variable: A class variable is nothing but a variable that is defined outside the constructor. 
A class variable is also called as a static variable.

Accessor(Getters): If you want to fetch the value from an instance variable we call them accessors.

Mutator(Setters): If you want to modify the value we call them mutators.
