Problem statement
I own a single-storey parking lot that can hold up to 'n' cars at any given point in time.
Each slot is given a number starting at 1 increasing with increasing distance from the
entry point in steps of one. I want to create an automated ticketing system that allows
my customers to use my parking lot without human intervention.
When a car enters my parking lot, I want to have a ticket issued to the driver. The ticket
issuing process includes us documenting the registration number (number plate) and
the colour of the car and allocating an available parking slot to the car before actually
handing over a ticket to the driver. The customer should be allocated a parking slot
which is nearest to the entry. At the exit the customer returns the ticket which then
marks the slot they were using as being available.
We interact with the system via a simple set of commands which produce a specific
output. Please take a look at the example below, which includes all the commands you
need to support - they're self explanatory
It should accept a file path as input and log the output to the console.
Example
$ <your_run_command> inputs.txt
