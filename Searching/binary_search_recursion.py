"""
We basically ignore half of the elements just after one comparison.

Compare x with the middle element.
If x matches with middle element, we return the mid index.
Else If x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in right half subarray after the mid element. So we recur for right half.
Else (x is smaller) recur for the left half
