"""
A simple approach is to do linear search, i.e

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
If x matches with an element, return the index.
If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
"""
# linearly search x in arr[].
# If x is present then return its location,
# otherwise return -1

    for i in range(0, n):
        if (arr[i] == e):
